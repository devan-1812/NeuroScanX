🚀 **NeuroScanX – Multimodal AI Health Insight & Triage System**

Advanced Medical Reasoning • Image + Text Analysis • Trend Tracking • Voice Summaries • PDF Reports

NeuroScanX is a next-generation AI-powered medical insight engine designed to analyze symptoms using multimodal inputs — images, text, voice, timelines, and medication photos — and produce safe, structured, clinically styled triage reports.

Built for the Google DeepMind – Vibe Code With Gemini 3 Hackathon, NeuroScanX demonstrates how modern AI can support users with responsible, high-quality health insights while strictly avoiding diagnoses and prioritizing safety.

🌟 Key Features

🔍 1. Multimodal Symptom Analysis

Uploads images (e.g., red eyes, facial swelling) and combines visual cues with text-described symptoms for unified clinical reasoning.

🧵 2. Symptom Timeline & Trend Analyzer

Understands day-wise logs, detects progression patterns, and highlights worsening/improving symptom trends.

🎙️ 3. Voice → Clinical Summary Conversion

Automatically transcribes voice notes and transforms them into clean, structured subjective clinical notes.

💊 4. Safe Medicine Identifier

Recognizes tablets or packaging at a category level while enforcing strict safety rules (no prescribing, no drug claims).

🔁 5. Dual Image Comparison (Day 1 vs Day X)

Compares two images of the same region to identify changes such as increased redness, swelling, or irritation.

📊 6. Health Radar Score (AI Wellness Metrics)

  Generates 5 quantitative indicators:
  
-> Hydration Likelihood

-> Fatigue Level

-> Stress Influence

-> Inflammatory Load Probability

-> Symptom Severity Index


📝 7. Professional Clinical Reporting

Outputs include:

-> Patient-friendly explanations

-> Detailed analysis cards

-> SOAP-format doctor report

-> Structured JSON → downloadable PDF summaries


🔒 Safety

NeuroScanX never provides diagnoses, never prescribes medication, and always encourages proper medical follow-up. It follows strict safety rules for urgent symptoms and uncertainty handling.
